########## Finding and Fixing Unquoted Service Paths ##########
#####################################################################################################
## Code Author: Jeff Liford
## Modified by: Seth Feaganes (@Net_Sec_Jedi)
## Original: http://www.ryanandjeffshow.com/blog/2013/04/11/powershell-fixing-unquoted-service-paths-complete/
##
## A powershell script which will search the registry for unquoted service paths and properly quote
## them. If run in a powershell window exclusively, this script will produce no output other than
## a line with "The operation completed successfully" when it fixes a bad key. Verbose output can
## be enabled by uncommenting the Write-Progress or Write-Output lines OR running the original scripts
## as intended with command pipes.
##
## This script was modified from the original three scripts named Get-SVCPath.ps1, Find-BADSVCPath.ps1,
## and Fix-BADSVCPath.ps1 to allow it to be run as a single script on one system or for use in mass
## deployment systems such as PDQDeploy, KACE, etc for example. If you require the functionality of those
## scripts for auditing, execution over multiple systems, or any other options those scripts provide, please
## use those scripts instead. I am posting this modification as reference to something useful in situations
## where a quick fix is necessary. 
##
## Myself nor the original author of this code cannot be held liable for any damage incurred running
## this in a production environment. Please take proper precautions before modifying the registry
## such as running this script with the REG ADD line commented out or taking a backup of the registry
## prior to running the script. Or obviously on virtual environments, etc.
